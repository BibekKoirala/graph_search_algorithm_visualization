# Graph Search Algorithm Visualization

This project is a visualization tool for graph search algorithms including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* (A Star). The app allows users to select an algorithm, grid type, animation times, and grid size to visualize the search process.

## Description

This React application visualizes various graph search algorithms. Users can configure the algorithm type, grid type, animation times, and grid size before starting the search. The visualization helps in understanding how different algorithms explore the graph.

## Algorithms

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### DFS (Depth-First Search)
DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### A* (A Star)
A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm that is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. It uses a best-first search and finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-search-visualization.git
   cd graph-search-visualization

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

## Usage

To use the application:

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Select a grid type from the dropdown menu. You must select both a start and stop grid type for the search to start.
4. Optionally, set the animation time in milliseconds.
5. Optionally, set the grid size.
6. Click "Start Search" to begin the visualization.
